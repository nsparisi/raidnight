    <h1>Raid Night</h1>
    <p class="flavor">The safari guide motions to a cave opening off in the distance. 
        "And over there is our very own dragon's lair. See that red creature perched on top? 
        That's Steve the Dragon, everyone wave to Steve! 
        The legends say there are great riches deep within the cavern which Steve has been defending for thousands of years. 
        Anywho, have your cameras ready. If we're lucky Steve will breathe some fire for us, making for a great photo-op."<br /><br />
