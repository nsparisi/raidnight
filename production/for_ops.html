<h2>Hints:</h2>

<h3>Knight strategy</h3>
<p>The Knight's role is in protecting the party and being an easy target to heal. You can choose to spend her mana defensively or offensively. Start by spending her mana in a defensive fashion and build a 5-10 turn rotation to stay alive.</p>
<p>Start the Knight with a basic 5-turn rotation using Taunt, Strike, and ShieldWall. ShieldWall can be maintained with 100% uptime.</p>

<h3>Priest strategy</h3>
<p>The Priest's primary complication is in balancing healing output vs. mana efficiency. Start by ignoring mana efficiency and use skills with the highest healing output per turn. Then work backwards to conserve mana where healing is not needed.</p>
<p>The Priest's Regen ability has the highest healing output for its cast time of 1 turn. Keep this cast on all players once per 10 turns. If using a defensive playstyle with the Knight, look to use Hymn and GreaterHeal to conserve mana.</p>

<h3>Wizard strategy in Cave Entrance (1st Dragon)</h3>
<p>The Wizard's responsibility is optimizing damage output in order to beat the fight before the Priest and Wizard run out of mana. Build a skill rotation that makes full use of Frostbite and Icespear. Don't forget Deluge and WaterBarrier can be used to recover some mana.</p>

<h3>Wizard strategy in Sunken Forest (2nd Dragon)</h3>
<p>Scorch can build endless stacks. Casting it as often as possible on the same target will cause a snowball effect, dealing high damage.</p>
<p>Casting Cauterize when at 100% mana will clear the bind effect in a single turn.</p>

<h3>Wizard strategy in Ancient Palace (3rd Dragon)</h3>
<p>The Wizard takes extra damage when high on mana (temperature), be sure to keep the Wizard mana low when the dragon casts HALT.</p>

<h3>General strategy in Cave Entrance (1st Dragon)</h3>
<p>The Dragon's FlameThrower and FireStorm deal incredible amounts of damage and should be avoided by using the move action.</p>

<h3>General strategy in Sunken Forest (2nd Dragon)</h3>
<p>There is no 'right' order to attack the enemies, the fight can be beaten in different ways.</p>

<h3>General strategy in Ancient Palace (3rd Dragon)</h3>
<p>This fight is more about avoiding damage than racing to deal damage. Expect to move a lot to dodge lasers.</p>
<p>The dragon's ultimate, Reversal, replays the heroes abilities in reverse order. You will need to use skills in an order that will succeed forward and in reverse.</p>
<p>During the dragon's ultimate, Reversal, you can use plan to use skills previously skipped during FastForward exclusively during this time.</p>
