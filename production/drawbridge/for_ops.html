<h2>Hints:</h2>

<h3>Knight strategy</h3>
<p>The Knight's role is in protecting the party and being an easy target to heal. You can choose to spend her mana defensively or offensively. Start by spending her mana in a defensive fashion and build a 5-10 turn rotation to stay alive.</p>
<p>Start the Knight with a basic 5-turn rotation using Taunt, Strike, and ShieldWall. ShieldWall can be maintained with 100% uptime.</p>

<h3>Priest strategy</h3>
<p>The Priest's primary complication is in balancing healing output vs. mana efficiency. Start by ignoring mana efficiency and use skills with the highest healing output per turn. Then work backwards to conserve mana where healing is not needed.</p>
<p>The Priest's Regen ability has the highest healing output for its cast time of 1 turn. Keep this cast on all players once per 10 turns. If using a defensive playstyle with the Knight, look to use Hymn and GreaterHeal to conserve mana.</p>

<h3>Wizard strategy</h3>
<p>The Wizard's responsibility is optimizing damage output in order to beat the fight before the Priest and Wizard run out of mana. Build a skill rotation that makes full use of Frostbite and Icespear. Don't forget Deluge and WaterBarrier can be used to recover some mana.</p>

<h3>General strategy</h3>
<p>The Dragon's FlameThrower and FireStorm deal incredible amounts of damage and should be avoided by using the move action.</p>
